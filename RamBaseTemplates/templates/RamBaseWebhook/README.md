# RamBase Webhook Listener

This project was generated by the RamBase Webhook Listener template. The project is a default ASP.NET Core application with a controller listening for incoming webhooks on `/webhook`.

The controller validates the signature of the webhook with a token that can be set in `appsettings.json`. It is recommended to store this token outside of the source code and inject it at run time (for example by using environment variables).

Following is an example of a webhook payload:
````
{"SystemID":"JHCDEVSYS","RamBaseEventId":1164421,"EventType":"ContactUpdated","Database":"TEM-NO","RegisterTime":"2021-10-22T09:42:37+02:00","RegisterPid":8101,"Parameters":[{"ParameterName":"ContactId","ParameterValue":"122037"}]}
````

This payload has the signature `vld5wPTSmjxlRFu8dZ+GAWeM6HaWwtCh5PiHdKsOxPzSB1920rW6f19EFbuIrhJDagntGADyqVUq+Fi4R8Ku5w==`, which will be set in the http-header `x-rambase-signature`. The template includes methods for reading and validating the signature of the received payload.
